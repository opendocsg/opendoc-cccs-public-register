## Executive Summary

1. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“CCCS”) has issued an infringement decision (“ID”) today as it has assessed that the sale of Uber’s1 Southeast Asian business to Grab 2 in consideration of Uber holding a 27.5% stake in Grab (“Transaction”) has resulted in a substantial lessening of competition (“SLC”) in the market for two-sided platforms matching drivers and riders for the provision of booked chauffeured point-to-point transport services (“CPPT platform services”) in Singapore (“Platform Market”). 

2. After due consideration of the information obtained from Grab, Uber and third parties, CCCS finds that the Transaction has resulted in an SLC in the Platform Market by removing competition between Grab and Uber, which were each other’s closest competitor in the provision of CPPT platform services in Singapore. The merged entity is likely to be able to increase effective price and has evidently done so since the completion of the Transaction. Further, post-Transaction, Grab would have the ability and incentive to tie chauffeured private hire car (“CPHC”) rental companies and drivers who rent from these CPHC rental companies in exclusive arrangements and reinforce Grab’s position in the Platform Market by increasing the barriers to entry. 

3. Given that SLC concerns have arisen from the Transaction in the abovementioned market, CCCS has also assessed the claimed efficiencies submitted by Grab and Uber (collectively, “Parties”). However, CCCS finds that the evidence does not suggest that the efficiencies claimed by the Parties are demonstrable, timely and/or will be sufficient to outweigh the detriment to competition arising from the Transaction. 

4. Whilst Grab submitted to CCCS two (2) sets of commitment proposals dated 14 June 2018 and 26 July 2018 respectively, CCCS is of the view that neither would be appropriate or sufficient to address the SLC concerns arising from the Transaction in the Platform Market. 

5. For the reasons set out in this ID, CCCS finds that the Transaction has infringed section 54 of the Competition Act (Cap. 50B) (“Act”). As such, CCCS directs a set of remedies and imposes financial penalties upon the Parties.

## Chapter 1: The Facts

### A. BACKGROUND

1. On 26 March 2018, Grab3 and Uber4 (each a “Party”, and collectively referred to as the “Parties”) announced the sale of Uber’s Southeast Asian business to Grab in consideration of Uber acquiring a 27.5% stake in Grab (“Transaction”).5 

2. Prior to the aforesaid announcement, there had been news reports speculating that there could be a potential transaction between Grab and Uber without definite details. On 9 March 2018, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“CCCS”)6 sent a letter to each Party, explaining Singapore’s merger notification regime and CCCS’s corresponding powers to investigate, give directions, impose financial penalties and/or impose interim measures on merging parties. On 19 March 2018, Uber sent a letter informing CCCS that it will reach out to CCCS in the event it enters into an agreement that has effects on competition in Singapore. 

3. After the announcement of the Transaction, CCCS sent a second letter dated 26 March 2018 to the Parties requesting clarifications on the details of the Transaction and whether (and if so, when) the Parties intended to notify the Transaction to CCCS. 

4. CCCS notes that Uber and Grab began transferring Uber’s assets (including information and data) to Grab and migrating Uber drivers and riders to Grab’s chauffeured point-topoint transport platform (“CPPT platform”) immediately after the announcement and completion of the Transaction. 7 In particular, Uber started redirecting its riders and drivers to download the Grab app, and informing them that the Uber service will no longer be available in Southeast Asia after 8 April 2018.8 

5. On 27 March 2018, CCCS commenced an investigation into the Transaction under section 62 of the Competition Act (Cap. 50B) (“Act”) as there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that section 54 of the Act had been infringed. 

6. On 28 March 2018, at about 9.47 a.m., CCCS received the Parties’ joint response confirming the Transaction and the Parties’ intention to file a merger notification no later than 16 April 2018 (“28 March Response”). 9 

7. On 30 March 2018, CCCS issued its Notice of Proposed Interim Measures Directions10 (“Proposed IMD”), which was brought to the notice of, inter alia: a. Grab Holdings Inc. (“GHI”); b. Grab Inc. (“GI”); c. GrabCar Pte. Ltd. (“GrabCar”).; and d. Uber Singapore Technology Pte. Ltd. (“USG”), (collectively referred to as the “IMD Parties”). 

8. On 4 and 6 April 2018, the IMD Parties submitted written representations 11 which included proposals for alternative interim measures. CCCS considered the IMD Parties’ written representations together with feedback and information from third parties. 

9. On 13 April 2018, CCCS issued Interim Measures Directions (“IMD”) on the IMD Parties under section 67 of the Act which allows CCCS to give such directions, inter alia, that it considers necessary for the purpose of preventing any action that may prejudice the giving of any direction under section 69 of the Act upon the conclusion of CCCS’s investigation. Subsequently, on 7 May 2018, Smith & Williamson LLP (“S&W”) was appointed as the independent monitoring trustee, to monitor compliance with the IMD terms. 

10. From S&W’s review from 7 May 2018 to 3 September 2018, S&W found the following instances where the IMD had been breached: 
	
	a. Uber’s platform was not available from 00:00 to 09:51 on 7 May 2018; 

	b. The Parties breached paragraph 15 of the IMD by allowing Grab to receive operational data from Uber in or around June or July 2018; in addition, Grab also retained personal data of Singapore riders that have not chosen to move to the Grab platform following the data transfer of Uber in breach of paragraph 15 of the IMD; and 

	c. Grab also breached paragraph 16 of the IMD by entering into agreements with at least [] New Drivers (as defined in the IMD) on an exclusive basis. 

11. On 16 April 2018, CCCS received a joint notification from the Parties under section 58 of the Act for a decision on whether the Transaction has infringed section 54 of the Act. CCCS informed the Parties that the notification was not necessary given that CCCS was already investigating the merger, and that the information provided in the notification would be taken into account for the ongoing investigation.

12. On 5 July 2018, CCCS issued notices of the Proposed Infringement Decision (“PID”) to the Parties as referred to in paragraphs 352 and 354 below. The Parties submitted written representations to CCCS on 26 July 2018, 3 August 2018, 3 September 201814 and 6 September 2018, 15 and made oral representations on 2 August 2018.

13. During the course of CCCS’s investigations, CCCS made seven (7) formal requests for information pursuant to section 63 of the Act to each of Grab16 and Uber. 17 CCCS also sought and reviewed feedback from drivers ([] (“[]”) and [] (“[]”)), 14 competitors in the car rental market (comprising six (6) car rental operators which are Grab’s exclusive fleet partners,18 [], 19 and seven (7) car rental operators which are not affiliated with either of the Parties 20 ), four (4) competitors in the CPPT platform market,21 six (6) competitors in the taxi services market ([] (“[]”) and [] 22) and seven (7) corporate customers. 23 In addition, CCCS received 53 complaints from consumers, 72 complaints from drivers and 64 general complaints between 26 March 2018 and 19 June 2018.
